# PM Journal — GhostOdds Night Sprint

## [20:35] Sprint Kickoff
- Status: in-progress
- Created: SPRINT.md, DESIGN_SYSTEM.md, DECISIONS.md
- Created specs: RUST_DEV_SPEC.md, FRONTEND_SPEC.md, QA_AUDITOR_SPEC.md
- Git repo initialized locally (GitHub repo needs creation by Myk)
- Tooling gap: Rust/Anchor/Solana CLI not installed — agents must install
- Spawning agents now

## Agent Spawn Order
1. Frontend dev first (can work with mock data, no blockers)
2. Rust dev second (needs tooling install, longer setup)
3. QA auditor last (needs smart contract code to review)
